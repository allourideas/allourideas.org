Feature: Control Flag as Inappropriate
  In order to prevent unsavory materials from appearing on our site
  As a question administrator
  I should be able to allow or prevent Users from flagging choices as inappropriate

  Background:
    Given an idea marketplace exists with admin 'test@dkapadia.com' and password 'blah' and url 'test'
    And I sign in as "test@dkapadia.com/blah"
    And I am on the Admin page for 'test'

  Scenario: Flag defaults to off
    When I go to the Cast Votes page for 'test'
    Then I should not see "Flag as inappropriate"

  Scenario: I enable flag as inappropriate
    When I check "earl_flag_enabled"
    And I press "Save"
    And I go to the Cast Votes page for 'test'
    Then I should see "Flag as inappropriate"

  Scenario: I disable flag as inappropriate after enabling
    Given idea marketplace 'test' has enabled "flag as inappropriate"
    When I uncheck "earl_flag_enabled"
    And I press "Save"
    And I go to the Cast Votes page for 'test'
    Then I should not see "Flag as inappropriate"

  Scenario: I disable flag as inappropriate after enabling
    Given idea marketplace 'test' has enabled "flag as inappropriate"
    When I uncheck "earl_flag_enabled"
    And I press "Save"
    And I go to the Cast Votes page for 'test'
    Then I should not see "Flag as inappropriate"
