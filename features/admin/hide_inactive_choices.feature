Feature: Hide inactive choices
  In order to prevent unwanted choices from being displayed
  As a question administrator
  I should be able to hide choices by deactivating them

  Background:
    Given an idea marketplace quickly exists with url 'test'
    And idea marketplace 'test' has 3 ideas
    And I am on the Cast Votes page for 'test'
    And I save the current two choices

  Scenario: Inactive choices should be hidden from view results
    When I deactivate the saved left choice
    And I go to the View Results page for 'test'
    Then I should not see the saved left choice text
    And I should see the saved right choice text

  Scenario: Inactive choices should be shown on question admin page
                Given I sign in as the admin for 'test'
    When I deactivate the saved left choice
    And I go to the Admin page for 'test'
    Then I should see the saved left choice text
    And I should see the saved right choice text
    And I should see "Deactivated"
