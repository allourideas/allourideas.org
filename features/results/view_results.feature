Feature: View Results
  In order to be motivated to engage in this idea marketplace
  As a voter
  I want to be able to see current results

  Background:
    Given an idea marketplace quickly exists with url 'test'
    And idea marketplace 'test' has 20 ideas

  Scenario: User clicks all results
    Given I am on the View Results page for 'test'
    When I follow "»"
    Then I should not see "Idea #001"
    And I should see "Idea #011"
    And I should have the following query string:
       |page|2|

  Scenario: User clicks all results in french
    Given the default locale for 'test' is 'fr'
    And I am on the View Results page for 'test'
    When I follow "»"
    Then I should not see "Idea #001"
    And show me the page
    And I should see "Idea #011"
    And I should have the following query string:
       |page|2|
       |locale|fr|

  Scenario: A user should not be allowed to see the view results page if hidden
    Given idea marketplace 'test' has results hidden
    Given I am on the View Results page for 'test'
    Then I should see "The results from this wiki survey are only visible to the person who created it."

  Scenario: An admin should be allowed to see the view results page if hidden
    Given idea marketplace 'test' has results hidden
    And I sign in as the admin for 'test'
    Given I am on the View Results page for 'test'
    Then I should not see "The results from this wiki survey are only visible to the person who created it."
    And I should see "Ideas" within ".ideas-table"
