Feature: Add idea to marketplace
  In order to have ideas from the community be considered 
  A user
  Should be able to add their own idea while voting

  Background:
    Given an idea marketplace quickly exists with url 'test' and admin 'test@example.com/password'
    And I sign in as "test@example.com/password"
    And I am on the Cast Votes page for 'test'
    And no emails have been sent

    @javascript
    Scenario: Adding choice to unmoderated marketplace
      Given idea marketplace 'test' has enabled idea autoactivation
      When I upload an idea titled 'blah blah & blah'
      Then I should see "Your idea has been submitted for review" within ".idea-success"
      And the vote count should be 0
      And the idea count should be 2
      And admin activates last idea of "test"
      And I am on the Cast Votes page for 'test'
      And the idea count should be 3
      When I go to the View Results page for 'test'
      Then I should see "blah blah & blah"
      And I wait for background jobs to complete
      And "test@example.com" should receive an email
      When "test@example.com" opens the email
      Then they should see "[All Our Ideas] idea added to question: test name" in the email subject
      And they should see "Someone has uploaded the idea 'blah blah & blah' to your wiki survey" in the email body
      # And they should see "Based on your settings, we have auto-activated the idea" in the email body
      # When they click the first link in the email
      # Then I should see "You have successfully deactivated the idea 'blah blah & blah'"
