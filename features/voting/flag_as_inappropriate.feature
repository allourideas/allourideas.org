		And I fill in "inappropriate_reason" with "Because it's offensive"
		And I click the flag submit button
		Then the idea count should be 4
		And the saved left choice should not be active
		And "flag_test@test.com" should receive an email 
		When "flag_test@test.com" opens the email
		Then they should see "[All Our Ideas] Possible inappropriate idea flagged by user" in the email subject
		And they should see "Because it's offensive" in the email body
