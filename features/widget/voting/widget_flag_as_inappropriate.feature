  Background:
    Given an idea marketplace exists with admin 'flag_test@test.com' and url 'test' and 5 ideas
    And idea marketplace 'test' has enabled "flag as inappropriate"
    And I am on the WIDGET Cast Votes page for 'test'
    And I save the current left choice
    And I wait for background jobs to complete
    And no emails have been sent

      When I click the flag link for the left choice
      Then I should see "Please explain why this choice is inappropriate:"

    @widget
    @javascript
    Scenario: User submits a flag request
      When I click the flag link for the left choice
      And I fill in "new_flag_field" with "Because it's offensive"
      And I click the WIDGET flag submit button
      Then I should see "You flagged a choice as inappropriate." within ".tellmearea"
      And the saved left choice should not be active
      And I wait for background jobs to complete
      And "flag_test@test.com" should receive an email
      When "flag_test@test.com" opens the email
      Then they should see "[All Our Ideas] Possible inappropriate idea flagged by user" in the email subject
      And they should see "Because it's offensive" in the email body
