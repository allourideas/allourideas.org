= GoogleAnalytics

This plugin enables Google Analytics support in your application. By default
it will output the analytics code for every single page automatically, if it
is configured correctly. This is done by adding:

    Rubaidh::GoogleAnalytics.tracker_id = 'UA-12345-67'

to your <tt>config/environment.rb</tt>, inserting your own tracker id. This
can be discovered by looking at the value assigned to +_uacct+ in the
Javascript code.

If you want to disable the code insertion for particular pages, add the
following to controllers that don't want it:

    skip_after_filter :add_google_analytics_code

If you are running rails 2.1 or above add install this by adding:

    config.gem 'rubaidh-google_analytics', :lib => 'rubaidh/google_analytics', :source => 'http://gems.github.com'

and run:

    rake gems:install

Simple. :-)


== Note

This version of the plugin uses the new Google Analytics code (ga.js) by
default. To use the legacy tracking code add the following line to your
<tt>config/environment.rb</tt>:

    Rubaidh::GoogleAnalytics.legacy_mode = true

== Tracking outbound Links

Google Analytics only tracks intra-site links by default. To create an
outbound link that is tracked use the link_to_tracked helper:

    link_to_tracked(name, track_path = "/", options = {}, html_options = {})

You can use the track_path parameter to group your outbound links into logical
folders inside of Google Analytics.

The other forms of link_to are also supported:

    link_to_tracked_if(condition, name, track_path = "/", options = {}, html_options = {}, &block)
    link_to_tracked_unless(condition, name, track_path = "/", options = {}, html_options = {}, &block)
    link_to_tracked_unless_current(name, track_path = "/", options = {}, html_options = {}, &block)

To track outbound links, you should set

    Rubaidh::GoogleAnalytics.defer_load = false

This will move the tracking javascript to the top of your page.
(see http://www.google.com/support/googleanalytics/bin/answer.py?answer=55527&topic=11006)

Tracked links respect the legacy_mode flag.

Note: Link-tracking works by inserting onclick() code in the HTML. Because of
this, it will overwrite any onclick that you insert in the html_options hash.

== Using local copies of the Analytics Javascript files

Under certain circumstances you might find it valuable to serve a copy of the
Analytics JavaScript directly from your server to your visitors, and not
directly from Google. If your visitors are geograhically very far from Google,
or if they have low quality international bandwidth, the loading time for the
Analytics JS might kill the user experience and force you to remove the
valuable tracking code from your site.

This plugin now supports local copies of the legacy and new Analytics
JavaScript files, updated via a rake task and served courtesy of the Rails
AssetTagHelper methods. So even if you use asset hosts, the JS will be served
from the correct source and under the correct protocol (HTTP/HTTPS).

To enable cached copies and the following to your initialization code:

    Rubaidh::GoogleAnalytics.local_javascript = true

Use the following rake task to update the local copy of the JavaScript file:

    rake google_analytics:updates

To keep the file updated you can add the following to your Capistrano
configuration:

    after "deploy:symlink", "deploy:google_analytics"

    namespace :deploy do
      desc "Update local Google Analytics files"
      task :google_analytics, :role => :web do
        run "cd #{current_path} && rake google_analytics:update RAILS_ENV=#{ENV['RAILS_ENV']}"
      end
    end

The above Capistrano recipe will almost certainly need some adjustments based
on how you run your deployments, but you should get the idea.

== Overriding application-default values

If you're using one Rails application to serve pages across multiple domains,
you may wish to override the domain and tracker ID values on a
controller-by-controller or view-by-view basis. You can do this by setting the
override_domain_name and override_tracker_id properties. These properties are
automatically reset after each use, so the values you set for domain_name and
tracker_id (usually in an initializer) will apply to all other requests.

    before_filter :local_analytics

    def local_analytics
      Rubaidh::GoogleAnalytics.override_domain_name  = 'foo.com'
      Rubaidh::GoogleAnalytics.override_tracker_id  = 'UA-123456-7'
    end

See the documentation for the GoogleAnalytics class for other configuration
options.

Note: You will need to have the mocha gem installed to run the tests for this
plugin.
