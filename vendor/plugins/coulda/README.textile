h1. Coulda generators

A Rails plugin for feature, view, controller, model, & helper generators. It is meant to be used as part of an "Outside-In" Test-Driven Development cycle.

h2. Requirements

* "Cucumber":http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber
* "Shoulda":http://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda
* "Factory Girl":http://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl
* "Mocha":http://github.com/jferris/mocha

h2. Installation

    $ script/plugin install git://github.com/dancroak/coulda.git

h2. Feature generator

    $ script/generate feature Posts new create

generates...

<pre><code>  Scenario: Create a new post
    Given I am on the new post page
    When I create a 'post' named 'A new post'
    Then I should see 'A new post'</code></pre>

Now run it:

    $ cucumber features/posts.feature

The failure will be:

    undefined method `new_post_path'

To get past this error, we'll create just the route we need:

    map.resources :posts, :only => [:new]

Running the test again, we have a new failure:

    uninitialized constant PostsController

h2. Controller test generator

We've reached a point in our Outside-In cycle where we want to spiral down into a tighter feedback loop to unit test the non-existant controller.

    $ script/generate controller_test Posts new create

h2. Controller generator

    $ script/generate controller Posts new create

generates...


h2. Model generator

    $ script/generate model User

* factory (Factory Girl)
* unit test (Shoulda)
* migration
* model

h2. Helper generator

    $ script/generate helper Navigation

* empty helper test file
* empty helper module

h2. View generator

    $ script/generate view Posts new

h2. Model generator: belongs_to

    $ script/generate model post user:belongs_to

generates...

<pre><code>class CreatePosts < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def self.up
    create_table :posts do |t|
      t.belongs_to :user
      t.timestamps
    end

    add_index :posts, :user_id
  end

  def self.down
    remove_index :posts, :user_id
    drop_table :posts
  end
end

class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :user
end

class PostTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  should_belong_to :user
  should_have_index :user_id
end

Factory.define :post do |post|
  post.association(:user)
end</code></pre>

h2. Model generator: paperclip

    $ script/generate model design image:paperclip

* all the necessary columns in the migration
* "has_attached_file" in the model
* "should_have_attached_file" in unit test

<pre><code>class CreateDesigns < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def self.up
    create_table :designs do |t|
      t.string :image_file_name
      t.string :image_content_type
      t.integer :image_file_size
      t.datetime :image_updated_at
      t.timestamps
    end
  end

  def self.down
    drop_table :designs
  end
end

class Design < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_attached_file :image
end

class DesignTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  should "be valid with factory" do
    assert_valid Factory.build(:design)
  end
  should_have_attached_file :image
end</code></pre>
